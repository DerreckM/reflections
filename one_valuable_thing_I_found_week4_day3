One valuable thing I have found while doing Test Driven Development is to have
three terminal tabs open at once.  This allows me to view, edit, and save changes to
my test file, ruby file, and a third window to run my mrspec or rspec from.  Many
people use only two windows and toggle back and forth from the test file to executing
the test, it is only a matter of preference.  I have also used two windows with efficient
results.  I do not recommend any more than three tabs though, since it greatly affects
the user's ability to see all the code.  For most operations one or two tabs will suffice,
but when doing TDD in a small incremental way, you do not really need to see all your code at
any one time, so three tabs are fine.

Another thing I found, or rather, shown by a fellow classmate was the ability to make my Mac's application
dock smaller.  It was a fresh perspective that now allows me to see more of my terminal and browser
windows.  This small increase in real estate will pay dividends down the line.
