Dear Monday me,

TDD is a good way to incrementally test your code and perform tests to see that each
method works the way you want it to.  We had Hashrocket here on Wednesday and performed
several examples of test-driven development.

In classs we worked on another example involving a calculator with client requirements.
We had a tough time conceptualizing the idea before coding it.
