#Key takeaways from Rule 4 - Unlock Creativity...With Repetition:

1. "Drilling creates a foundation on which individual initiative and
   imagination can flourish."

2. When do you normally have your most creative thoughts? (while driving,
   in the shower, brushing your teeth, jogging....)  These tasks that we
   have done thousands of times can be done on autopilot freeing your mind
   to wander a little bit in settings where it used to be encumbered (Waypoints!)

3. A quarterback doesn't need to think about throwing, can focus on an open receiver.
   Similarly, by not focusing on typing or basic data structure construction, we
   can focus on what we really want our code to do

4. "Creativity, it turns out, is often practice in disguise, and to get more of it, it
   often helps to automate other things.

5. Push participants to reflect later, after they've practiced enough to better understand
   what they are doing.  =>  =>  => Sounds familiar, huh?

Case Study:  MBA group

Groups were split from 8 to 4.  This doubled repetitions each participant got.  On first
attempt, participants were all over the map in their approaches. (Unix, anyone?)  They make
weird gestures, but over time successful ideas begin to emerge and as a group they "get it."
