I've been having many challenges on the day 2 of working with Gems.  I missed
much of the Tuesday morning that was spent working on this, and have been
behind ever since.  Some challenges were simply realizing that you cannot run
rspec from the lib or bin directories, but needed to run it from the parent
gitloc directory.

The greatest frustration I feel is that when I fix one error, I immediately get
another.  This is going to be probably my toughest hurdle to becoming a developer,
I often don't have patience when things blow up.

The major error I had today was when I tried to run bin/gitloc "$PWD" and got message
"invalid byte sequence in UTF-8(ArgumentError).  This requires debugging gitloc,
using pry to identify where the gitloc file breaks.  I didn't know how to do this,
so Josh helped me trace where the error occurred.  The initial issue was with the
lib/gitloc.rb file at line 18 with the '!~'.  We placed a pry before line 18 using
'\p'.  The first two files already gave the expected output of the number of strings
items in the array and the file (or local variable).  THe third local variable
"gitloc-derreckmansheim-0.1.0.gem" contained a ridiculous amount of binary.  By
running pry> loc = File.readlines(filename).count which was where the code broke at
line 20 we discovered that the output 5 is the number of string lines of code (loc).
By typing at pry(main)> filename, We see the "gitloc-derreckmansheim-0.1.0.gem"
We want to change this by saying filename = "bin/gitloc", which changed the contents of
"gitloc-derreckmansheim-0.1.0.gem" to output 4, instead of a bunch of binary junk.
By prying into loc = File.readlines(filename).count { |line| line !~ /^\s*$/ } we saw
the regular expressions (regex) in which the /^\s*$/, means the regex in / / from
beginning of line (^) has whitespace (\s) unlimited (*) until end of line ($). If we
that when we pry into File.readlines(filename) we see five lines, the second of which
is empty with just "\n".  We can pry(main)> File.readlines(filename)[1] !~ /^\s*$/ =>
false.  All other lines output true.  We proceed to lib/gitloc.rb and remove that
blank line.

Now when I run bin/gitloc "$PWD" I get all the desired output, but lucky me, I get
yet another error that I will have to figure out later: bin/gitloc:5:in `<main>':
uninitialized constant Gitloc (NameError)
