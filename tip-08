#Tip 8 - To Build Hard Skills, Work Like a Careful Carpenter
The "sled on a snowy hill" phenomenon should hit home with anyone in some respect.
For me, I tend to follow the same path (tracks) regardless of how good the initial
repetitions were.  Breaking bad habits is difficult because you essentially need
to relearn something that you assume you already know.  Reconnecting wires in your
brain is much harder the second time around, than if you had learned the skill
correctly the first time.  In other words, go down the snowy hill slowly the first
time, being careful and paying attention to the bumps in the path.  Don't worry about
speed or efficiency, but rather on the individual movements or reps.

With VIM, I am still making errors that are annoying me, because I have not mastered
 how to do certain keybindings.  For instance, I can Add an opening quotation mark "
and then repeat that movement down quickly, but when I try to do the closing quotation
mark, I mess it up and revert to my old method of inserting them individually.
