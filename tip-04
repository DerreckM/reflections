 notebook allows you to not only write down ideas and information, but gives you the abil
ity to refer back to it and reflect on what you were thinking on any given day.  I general
ly write the date down before I begin taking notes and may describe where I am at and what
 I am doing, to help job my memory to that moment in time.
