Dear Me From Two Weeks Ago,

Take a deep breath.  All is well and will be well.  You will cover a lot of ground,
but only to realize that you have just skimmed the surface.  You'll learn many new
VIM key bindings that will make you significantly quicker and more efficient, you
will understand the 6 data structures: strings, numbers, booleans, hashes, arrays,
and nil. You will realize the power of linked lists.  Linked lists are useful for
many things, including the concept of inheritance for classes.

You will learn how to construct class structures, methods, local and instance
variables, constants, and peculiarities specific to Ruby.  Everything is an object
in Ruby.  You will learn the power of '!', which can change a variable by force.
Methods you may or may not have heard about work in interesting ways.

You will learn that a hashrocket (=>) will show you output (and also is part of a
hash, more on that later).

"ABC".downcase.reverse.upcase.chars.first => "C"

If you declare-
a = "ABC"
a.downcase => "abc"

Still however,
a = "ABC"  (does not change the assigned value)

If you want to change the assigned value, use:
a.downcase! => "abc"  (does change the assigned value)

Future me, or future-future you, will know modules and singleton methods.  I am only
just understanding the singleton method.  Like I said about just skimming the surface,
we got along way to go.
