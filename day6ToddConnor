#What do I want my world to look like on 20 May
I want to understand enough Ruby, HTML/CSS, Javascript, APIs, and frameworks to
create cool projects including animation


#Be specific about what you wrote on the sheet
I wrote that I wanted to be in a junior developer role (intern) at a company
  that does something interesting
networking
building apps that improve people's lives and the world we live in

#What company / domain / technologies / cities
A tech company using either Ruby or Python for development in Chicago.
I am not looking for work outside of Chicagoland.


#What things do you need to learn to get there
I believe most of what I need to know to get hired can be learned at CodePlatoon.
I have some additional coding experience from the traditional university route,
but currently lack the necessary hard skills to be a proficient junior dev.
I ultimately would like to go the startup route and provide something useful to society,
but that is something to consider 5-10 years down the road.

#What things would just be fun to learn
implementing maps, animation, creating Chunky images, building websites.  I like visual
learning, and so anything aesthetically pleasing would be fun to work with.
