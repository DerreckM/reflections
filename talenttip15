#Reflection: Little Book of Talent Tip #15, Break every move down into chunks.
THe main takeaway from this tip for me is to take it a little bit at a time. I often
stress out over all I have to do and forget to think about all I have to do as a series
of small things to do.  I wonder how I'll ever have time for everything, but if I just
focus on a few key things in a block of time, then go relax, or workout, and come back
and do some more stuff in another devoted block of time.  I know that if I incrementally
work on a project or study for an exam in 'chunks, I will have better overall understanding
and more thorough and thought out projects that I can be proud of.
