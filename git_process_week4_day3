I thought I knew most of git's functionality just from our committing and pushing files
to Github.  Little did I know that there is so much more capability, particularly when
working on group projects and/or pair programming.

One member of my team offered to be the host.  I kind of wish I had actually, just to
remember where the buttons were to do this.  The process involves inputting other
contributors' email addresses to give them commit access in order to push their changes
to the codebase into the shared main repository.

We pushed some things up to Github, but what we thought were files, were actually branches.
I did not realize you could push a full branch up to Github.

I guess I should backtrack and say that before you can commit branches to Github you need
to ensure you have all prior items committed.  You can say git status and see if there is
any uncommitted work.  Then I need to do a git pull to make sure I have the latest copy of
the code in the shared repository.  When we want to create a branch, we need to ensure we are
on the master branch and then we git checkout -b givename.  We do our work and then when
we are ready we git push -u origin givename.  Where my group had issues was with the next
step.  On Github you are to create a pull request to the master branch.  This is from the
third tab in github.  Then ANOTHER member of your team must merge your changes when they
deem them acceptable.  Finally, we go back to the master branch by git checkout master and
pull the new changes by git pull.  We are now ready to start the process over if we wish.
